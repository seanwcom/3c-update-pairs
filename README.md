Forked from jay23606's initial code - if you're browsing this, thanks for the code. Simple, but super effective. :)

Updates a 3commas composite bot's pairs based on lunarcrush's altrank and galaxy scores

Update 3commas key, secret, market, botId, MAX_ALTRANK_PAIRS, MAX_GALAXY_PAIRS variables.

By default it will try and add the top 50 altrank and the top 50 galaxy pairs if they exist on your exchange.
